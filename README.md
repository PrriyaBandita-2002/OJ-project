# Online Judge Platform

A full-stack Online Judge (OJ) platform built with the MERN stack. Supports competitive programming features like problem solving, code execution, live contests, time-travel debugging, and an AI-powered debugging assistant.



##  Features

###  Core Functionality
- Problem Bank: Create, edit, and manage coding problems with constraints, examples, hidden test cases, and starter code.
- Code Editor: Editor with syntax highlighting using Prism.js, supporting C/C++, Java, and Python.
- Test Case Evaluation: Automatic evaluation using public and hidden test cases.
- Submissions: Stores each submission with verdicts, runtime, test case results, and timestamps.

### Contests
- Live Contests: Time-bound contests with real-time countdown timers.
- Access Control: Problems are accessible only during the active contest window.

###  Analytics
- Dashboard: Tracks number of problems solved, submission history, average submission time, and participation stats.

###  Debugging Tools
- AI Debug Assistant: Ask questions like "Why is my loop failing?" and get targeted AI feedback on failed code.



## Tech Stack

### Frontend
-React.js, Tailwind CSS
- Code Editor: `react-simple-code-editor`, `Prism.js`

### Backend
- **Node.js**, **Express.js**
- **MongoDB** (with Mongoose)
- **Docker** for secure code execution environments

### Authentication
- JWT-based Authentication
- Role-Based Access: `admin`, `problem_setter`, `user`
- Firebase/Google Sign-In support (optional)



##  Supported Languages

- C / C++
- Java
- Python

> All programs run inside secure, isolated Docker containers with resource/time constraints.
